# A3_ontology
A3 folder is the java code for running the queries. Open as existing Maven project in Eclipse.
ep_v2 contains the fuseki-server executable. cd to folder and $./fuseki-server
Data should not need to be loaded, however I have included a file called 'ontology_data.owl' in the repo just incase it is needed.
Queries.txt contains sample queries to test on the data
ontology_data.owl (despite having .owl file extention) is actaully an RDFXML file.
